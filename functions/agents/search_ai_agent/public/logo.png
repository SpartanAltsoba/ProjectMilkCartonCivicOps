// There is no specific code required for a static asset file such as 'public/logo.png'.
// To use this file within your Next.js application, you just need to ensure that the image file
// 'logo.png' is placed in the 'public' directory of your Next.js project. This directory serves
// static files and assets that can be directly referenced in your components and pages.
//
// To display this image in a Next.js component, you can use the 'Image' component from 'next/image'
// module (recommended for optimized loading) or directly use an 'img' tag pointing to '/logo.png'.
//
// Here is an example usage with the 'next/image' component:

import Image from 'next/image';
