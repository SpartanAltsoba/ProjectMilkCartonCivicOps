System Component | NGO Involvement | Typical NGOs | Risks
1. Mandated Reporting & Intake | Indirect | School systems run by nonprofits, hospital systems, clergy institutions | Overreporting due to liability fears, bias, poor training
2. Legal Petitioning / Removal Authorization | Rare | Some legal advocacy orgs (e.g. CASA), but less direct | CASA/GAL may support removals based on limited info
3. Family & Dependency Court | High | Court-appointed legal aid, CASA/GAL, supervised visitation centers | Conflicts of interest, minimal parent support
4. Foster Care Operations | Extremely High | Foster placement agencies (e.g., Bethany, KVC, Youth Villages) | Per diem incentives to retain placements; neglect of quality
5. Runaway & Recovery Response | Moderate | NGOs sometimes operate shelters, hotline recovery services | Inconsistent tracking/reporting, poor conditions
6. Parent Service Access / Compliance Monitoring | Very High | Parenting classes, substance abuse treatment, counseling, supervised visitation | Service bottlenecks, low-quality vendors, billing fraud
7. Mental & Behavioral Health Pipeline | Very High | Clinics run by nonprofits or religious organizations | Overdiagnosis, inappropriate medication, waitlists
8. Contractor Oversight & Audits | NGOs are the entities being audited | State hires them as providers, not auditors | Regulatory capture: same group receiving funds may advise state
9. Policy Implementation / Legislative Advocacy | High influence via lobbying | Child welfare think tanks, lobbying orgs (e.g., Casey Family Programs) | Policy capture, lobby for more removals = more business
10. CINA / FINS / PINS | Moderate | Family preservation orgs, wraparound services, juvenile justice NGOs | Court-ordered programs not accessible or effective
