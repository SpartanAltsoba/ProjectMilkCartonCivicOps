rectangle "POTENTIAL MISUSE:\n• 'Needs' designation triggers court involvement\n• Insufficient actual services provided\n• Risk of placing child into custody anyway" as M9

rectangle "INPUT:\nFamily/Child Behavior or Situation\n(Truancy, Incorrigible Behavior,\nNeglect/Abuse Concern)" as C9_Input
rectangle "DECISION POINT:\nFiling a CINA/FINS/PINS Petition\n(Who: School, Agency, Parent, or Court)" as C9_Decision
rectangle "ACTION:\nCourt Orders Services or Supervision\nBut Services May Be Underfunded or Unavailable" as C9_Action
rectangle "OUTCOME:\nChild/Family Deemed 'Noncompliant'\nIf Services Not Accessed or\nBehavior Persists" as C9_Outcome
rectangle "FAILURE CASCADE:\nPotential Removal, Detention,\nOr Escalation to Delinquency System" as C9_Failure
rectangle "PMC Intervention:\n1) Ensure Sufficient Services\n2) Monitor for Overuse of Custody\n3) Advocate for True Family Supports" as C9_PMC

L9 --> M9 : "Statutes can be\npunitive if services\nnot actually provided"
L9 --> C9_Decision : "CINA/FINS/PINS\npaths vary by state"
M9 --> C9_Action : "Court involvement\nbecomes default"

C9_Input --> C9_Decision
C9_Decision --> C9_Action
C9_Action --> C9_Outcome
C9_Outcome --> C9_Failure

C9_Action -[dashed]-> C9_PMC : "Push for actual\nfunded interventions"
