rectangle "OUTCOME:\nRepeated Failures Unseen,\nNo Accountability" as C7_Outcome
rectangle "FAILURE CASCADE:\nSystemic Abuse Continues,\nPerpetrators Unchecked" as C7_Failure
rectangle "PMC Intervention:\n1) Monitor Gov Filings\n2) Push for Independent Audits\n3) Publish Missed Audit Data" as C7_PMC

L7 --> M7 : "Weak enforcement or\npolitical pressure"
L7 --> C7_Decision : "Mandated audits exist\nbut can be bypassed"
M7 --> C7_Action : "Inaction by\nresponsible agencies"

C7_Decision --> C7_Action
C7_Action --> C7_Outcome
