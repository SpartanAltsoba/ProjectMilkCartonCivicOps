# CIVIC TRACE OPS — Feature Specification

## 1. Problem Statement

Child welfare systems, especially at the county level, often lack transparency, making it difficult for parents, caregivers, and concerned citizens to track accountability and decision-making pathways. **CIVIC TRACE OPS** addresses this by helping users identify and map the individuals (caseworkers, judges, attorneys, etc.) and agencies involved in child welfare cases, uncover potential gaps or failures, and proactively request information (FOIA) to ensure accountability.

## 2. Core Users & Personas

1. **Concerned Parent**

   - **Motivation**: Wants clarity on how child welfare decisions are made and by whom.
   - **Needs**: Clear, jargon-free data on decision-makers and case status, guidance on submitting FOIA requests.
   - **Frustrations**: Lack of transparency, difficulty navigating multiple agencies.

2. **Legal Advocate**

   - **Motivation**: Represents families or children in the system, needs accurate records of case histories.
   - **Needs**: In-depth data on all stakeholders, prior decisions, performance indicators, and potential conflicts of interest.
   - **Frustrations**: Slow or incomplete responses from agencies, complicated data structures.

3. **Community Watchdog**

   - **Motivation**: Monitors local governance and social services, seeks to ensure ethical behavior and compliance.
   - **Needs**: Aggregated, analyzable data on child welfare spending, performance metrics, and any red flags.
   - **Frustrations**: Complex bureaucratic processes, data scattered across multiple sources.

## 3. Functional Features

1. **Location-Based Search**
   - Users can select their state and county to view relevant agencies, officials, and metrics.
2. **Decision Chain Visualization**
   - Dynamic map or list of key decision-makers in local child welfare (CPS employees, judges, contractors).
3. **Risk Score Dashboard**
   - Simple indicator system flagging potential red flags like excessive caseloads, repeated grievances, or pending investigations.
4. **FOIA Request Generation**
   - Guided forms to auto-generate state-specific FOIA requests for data such as case assignments or financial records.
5. **Evidence Export**
   - Ability to download compiled results and relevant documents in a unified file for legal or personal record-keeping.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance/Speed**:
   - The platform should serve search results and generate visualizations within 3 seconds on average.
2. **Privacy & Security**:
   - Must protect sensitive user data and any PII gleaned from child welfare records.
   - Use secure connections (HTTPS) and role-based access if needed.
3. **Audit Logging**:
   - Every FOIA request or data retrieval action is logged to ensure accountability and traceability.
4. **Maintainability & Scalability**:
   - Code base must be modular, allowing for easy addition of new data sources or states.

## 5. Prioritized Feature Table

| Priority        | Feature                                  | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Must Have**   | State/County Selector                    | Allow users to pick relevant jurisdiction.                   |
| **Must Have**   | Decision Chain Visualization             | Show key stakeholders in child welfare cases.                |
| **Must Have**   | FOIA Request Generation                  | Automated forms for critical data requests.                  |
| **Should Have** | Risk Score Dashboard                     | Highlight potential issues or conflicts.                     |
| **Should Have** | Evidence Export                          | Bundle findings for offline review.                          |
| **Could Have**  | Real-time Alerts or Watchdog Integration | Alert system if certain thresholds or metrics are triggered. |

## 6. Known Constraints

1. **Data Gaps**
   - Certain counties may not release digitized data.
   - FOIA response times vary widely, creating incomplete or outdated datasets.
2. **FOIA Latency**
   - Official turnaround times for FOIA can be weeks or months, causing data staleness.
   - Some states have different forms or processes, requiring adaptation for each.
3. **Legal & Privacy Considerations**
   - # Must comply with state and federal confidentiality requirements for child welfare records.
