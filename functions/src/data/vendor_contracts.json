DHHS had contracted Saint Francis Ministries (a Kansas-based nonprofit) in to serve as the lead agency for child welfare case management in the eastern service area (Omaha metro). The -year, $ million contract with Saint Francis was supposed to cover foster care case management and services for that region . However, the contract faced serious problems: Saint Francis underbid and struggled financially and programmatically. Nebraska terminated its contract with Saint Francis in December due to failure to meet requirements . Effective January , DHHS took back direct case management for the Omaha area . Saint Francis\u2019s contract, which had been supplemented by emergency funds (an extra $ million) to keep it afloat, was cut short . After termination, Nebraska ended the privatization model \u2013 the state now directly manages all foster care cases statewide. Saint Francis was retained in a limited role as a foster care support agency (recruiting and licensing foster homes) but no longer oversees case management . In , Nebraska\u2019s legislature even passed a bill to prohibit such lead-agency privatization going forward (ending the decade-long experiment). In summary: Nebraska\u2019s last vendor contract for foster care (Saint Francis, \u2013) was terminated . Currently, no private vendor runs hotline, intake, or core foster care/reunification services in Nebraska; those are back with DHHS."

Upstate, counties like Westchester, Monroe, Erie, etc., also contract out significant portions of foster care to local nonprofits. These contracts are typically ongoing and renewed every few years; for example, NYC\u2019s contract cycle is every \u2013 years.

Investigations are done by county Children Services agencies. Reunification & Foster Care Placement: Ohio counties have significant flexibility and many contract with private agencies. Especially in urban counties, a large portion of foster care is managed by private providers under contract. For example, Cuyahoga County (Cleveland) and Franklin County (Columbus) use private agencies for placement of children: they refer foster cases to agencies like Ohio MENTOR, SAFY, Pressley Ridge, etc., which recruit foster families and supervise the homes. Nevertheless, the county agency typically retains legal case management oversight and court reporting. Some counties (e.g. Hamilton County/ Cincinnati) have contracted out case management for certain cases to private agencies in the past. Ohio also contracts private nonprofits for reunification and prevention programs (like NW Ohio Regional CAC or provider networks for in-home services).

Investigations are conducted by county Children and Youth agencies (county-run CPS). No outsourcing of the hotline itself (though a few years ago there were concerns about unanswered calls, but the state addressed that internally ). Reunification & Foster Care Placement: Pennsylvania is state-supervised, county-administered, and many counties outsource substantial parts of foster care services to private agencies. For example, Philadelphia DHS outsources virtually all in-home case management for foster care to a network of Community Umbrella Agencies (CUAs) (private nonprofits). \u201cThe Department of Human Services outsources the task of checking in on kids in foster care and kinship care to a network of nonprofit providers, called \u2018community umbrella agencies\u2019\u2026 covering geographic areas in the city\u201d . Until recently, CUAs (e.g. Turning Points for Children, Catholic Social Services, Northeast Treatment Centers, etc.) managed Philadelphia\u2019s foster care cases under city contracts. (In \u2013, two CUAs withdrew, causing the city to rebid those regions ). Pittsburgh\u2019s Allegheny County also contracts private agencies for foster care and kinship case management support (e.g. wards are often co-managed with agencies like Holy Family Institute). Many other Pennsylvania counties contract with provider agencies for placement services, foster home recruitment, and reunification programs (for instance, Diakon, Pressley Ridge, FCCY manage many foster homes across multiple counties under contracts). The common theme: County agencies hold legal case responsibility but private agencies carry out casework services under contract in much of PA. These contracts are typically ongoing; if no new ones in the past two years, the last known contracts remain in effect (if a contract lapsed, typically a new RFP was issued). For example, Philadelphia had to allocate an extra $ million to reorganize CUA contracts after the two nonprofits dropped out .

No recent contracts handing off those functions entirely to a private entity were found; Utah\u2019s system remains state-run with contracted support in limited areas."

DCF may contract some services (like family visitation centers to organizations such as Easterseals VT, and perhaps therapeutic foster care through agencies), but primary case management stays with DCF. No information in connected sources of vendor contracts for running foster placements/ reunification; Vermont continues with a public model."

The hotline is public (no outsourcing). Local DSS offices investigate reports. Reunification & Foster Care Placement: Virginia\u2019s local departments of social services manage foster care cases. Many localities contract with private agencies for certain placements \u2013 e.g. Virginia makes heavy use of private child-placing agencies for therapeutic foster care. Roughly half of Virginia\u2019s foster children are placed through private agencies that are reimbursed by the state. For reunification and services, local DSS often refer families to private providers (counseling, FFT, etc.). But the legal case management and decisionmaking remain with the public DSS agencies. No new statewide privatization found; Virginia maintains its mixed system with state oversight and local DSS contracting some services to private agencies. (Note: Virginia is state-supervised, locally-administered, so each locality may have its own contracts with agencies like UMFS, Intercept, etc., for foster home management.)"

Reunification & Foster Care Placement: Washington has generally kept foster care case management public (historically, an attempt in the 2010s to outsource case management via \u201cPerformance Based Contracts\u201d was reversed by ). DCYF does contract with many private agencies for specific services: e.g. Family Preservation Services contracts, Behavioral Rehabilitation Services (therapeutic group homes), and private agencies that recruit foster families (particularly for therapeutic foster care). For instance, agencies like Olive Crest or Catholic Community Services might manage certain foster homes under contract. However, as of the last two years, Washington has not transferred general foster care case management to private contractors \u2013 DCYF social workers still manage cases and coordinate reunification. No new vendor-run model has been implemented; the system remains state-run with contracted service providers."

    "notes": "Hotline & Intake: Wisconsin is state-supervised, county-run. Each county has its own CPS intake (no single hotline; some counties collaborate). Milwaukee is a special case where the state (DCF) took over in . The hotlines are public; Milwaukee\u2019s intake is run by DCF\u2019s Division of Milwaukee Child Protective Services. No outsourcing of hotline operations. Reunification & Foster Care Placement: Wisconsin\u2019s counties generally manage foster care, but Milwaukee County\u2019s foster care has been privatized since due to a lawsuit (the \u201cMichael Q.\u201d settlement). In Milwaukee, DCF contracts private agencies to perform foster care case management. As of recent years, Children\u2019s Hospital of Wisconsin Community Services and SaintA (now Wellpoint) were two primary contractors managing Milwaukee foster care cases under contract with the state. Those contracts include reunification services, recruitment, and case management for assigned cases. (Milwaukee\u2019s model is essentially like Florida/Kansas on a county scale.) Outside Milwaukee, other counties use private agencies for certain services \u2013 e.g. foster parent recruitment via Coalition for Children, Youth & Families (formerly known as Foster Care and Adoption Resource Center, which had a state contract now evolving into a Family Connections Center). Some counties contract private agencies for specific cases (Brown County has used Catholic Charities for treatment foster care, for example). Within the last two years: Wisconsin DCF has restructured some support contracts (the Foster Care and Adoption Resource Center contract was rebid in into a new Family Connections Center model ). Milwaukee\u2019s private case management contracts were also reprocured effective (SaintA did not rebid one region, resulting in a new provider taking over that area). In summary: Wisconsin\u2019s foster care is partially privatized (notably Milwaukee\u2019s ongoing contracts), but not a statewide private takeover. Hotline/intake remain public functions."
