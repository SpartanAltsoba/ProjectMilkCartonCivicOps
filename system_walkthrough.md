# Project Milk Carton Civic Ops - Current System State

## Currently Functional Components

### 1. Entity Management System

**Location:** `src/models/entity_index.ts`, `src/core/id_linker.ts`
**Status:** FUNCTIONAL

Current capabilities:

- File-based entity storage with locking mechanism
- Deterministic entity key generation from multiple ID types
- ID harmonization and collision detection
- Atomic write operations with file-level locking
- Entity search by jurisdiction, name, and alternate IDs

Flow:

1. Entity data enters through IdLinker
2. IdLinker generates deterministic key using sorted ID hash
3. EntityIndex stores entity with atomic write operations
4. Concurrent access handled through file locking

### 2. Document Store

**Location:** `src/core/document_store.ts`
**Status:** FUNCTIONAL

Current capabilities:

- Document fingerprinting
- Content normalization
- Deduplication
- Source URL tracking
- Atomic storage operations

Flow:

1. Documents received from any source
2. Text normalized and fingerprinted
3. Stored with metadata including source and scenario hash
4. Retrievable by document hash or scenario context

### 3. Graph Database Integration

**Location:** `src/models/neo4j_entity_store.ts`
**Status:** PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL

Current capabilities:

- Neo4j connection management
- Constraint creation
- Basic CRUD operations
- Retry logic for failed operations

Limitations:

- Cypher queries for cycle detection not implemented
- Link inference not implemented
- Production-ready error handling missing

Flow:

1. Receives nodes and edges from CorrelationWorker
2. Attempts to upsert with retry logic
3. Maintains scenario context through tagging

### 4. Core Data Processing

**Location:** `src/workers/correlation_worker.ts`
**Status:** PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL

Current capabilities:

- Graph merge operations
- Node type inference
- Basic edge creation
- Orphan node detection
- Graph validation for critical relations

Limitations:

- Circular flow detection stubbed
- Link inference logic stubbed
- Neo4j integration needs actual query implementation

Flow:

1. Receives raw facts about entities
2. Harmonizes IDs through EntityIndex
3. Constructs graph structure
4. Validates critical relations
5. Attempts to store in Neo4j

### 5. Risk Analysis System

**Location:** `src/workers/analyst_worker.ts`
**Status:** PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL

Current capabilities:

- Rule-based risk scoring
- Hybrid scoring system framework
- Violation flagging
- Confidence thresholds
- Fallback to rules-only mode

Limitations:

- ML model not implemented
- Precision/recall metrics not measured
- Gold dataset validation not implemented

Flow:

1. Receives graph data
2. Applies statutory rules
3. Attempts ML scoring (currently stubbed)
4. Falls back to rules if ML confidence low
5. Generates violation flags

   - Coverage measurements not implemented
   - Latency tracking not implemented
2. **Advisory System**

   - PDF/DOCX rendering not implemented
   - Action generation not implemented
   - UI integration not implemented
3. **Decision Chain UI**

   - Renderer not implemented
   - Live COA pop-outs not implemented
   - Parent happy path not implemented
4. **Testing Infrastructure**

   - Cypress tests not implemented
   - Acceptance tests not implemented
   - Performance metrics not implemented
   - Canary tests not implemented
5. **Production Infrastructure**

   - Circuit breakers not implemented
   - Comprehensive monitoring not implemented
   - Deployment stack not implemented
   - Self-heal framework not implemented

## Current Data Flow

```
[Document/Entity Input]
         ↓
[EntityIndex + IdLinker] → FUNCTIONAL
         ↓
[Document Store] → FUNCTIONAL
         ↓
[CorrelationWorker] → PARTIAL
         ↓
[Neo4j Store] → PARTIAL
         ↓
[AnalystWorker] → PARTIAL
         ↓
[Risk Scores & Flags] → PARTIAL
```

Everything after this point is NOT IMPLEMENTED.

## System Limitations

1. **Data Ingestion**

   - Only file-based entity storage works
   - No real-time data ingestion
   - No API integration
2. **Processing**

   - Graph operations limited to basic CRUD
   - No sophisticated pattern detection
   - No ML-based analysis
3. **Output**

   - No rendered templates
   - No UI integration
   - No automated actions
4. **Monitoring**

   - No performance metrics
   - No error tracking
   - No system health monitoring

## Current System State Summary

- Core entity management: FUNCTIONAL
- Document handling: FUNCTIONAL
- Graph operations: PARTIAL
- Analysis capabilities: PARTIAL
- Everything else: NOT IMPLEMENTED

The system currently functions as a basic entity management and document storage system with partial graph database integration and rule-based analysis. It cannot yet perform its intended function of comprehensive civic oversight due to missing critical components.

## Deliverables Created:

1. **Updated Task Log** (`task_log.md`) - Comprehensive status tracking with exit criteria alignment
2. **System Walkthrough** (`system_walkthrough.md`) - Current functional state documentation

## Core Components Implemented:

### Sprint S-1: EntityIndex & ID Harmonizer ✅ COMPLETE

* `src/models/entity_index.ts` - File-based entity storage with atomic operations
* `src/core/id_linker.ts` - Deterministic entity key generation
* Exit criteria met: 100% IDs produce deterministic entity_key

### Sprint S-2: Recon Worker ⚠️ PARTIAL

* `src/workers/recon_worker.ts` - Basic structure with CSE/FEC adapter framework
* `src/core/document_store.ts` - Document fingerprinting and deduplication

### Sprint S-3: Correlation Worker ⚠️ PARTIAL

* `src/workers/correlation_worker.ts` - Graph merge and validation logic
* `src/models/neo4j_entity_store.ts` - Neo4j integration with retry mechanisms

### Sprint S-4: Analyst Worker ⚠️ PARTIAL

* `src/workers/analyst_worker.ts` - Hybrid scoring system with rules + ML fallback

## System Status: 25% Complete

The system currently functions as a basic entity management and document storage platform with partial graph database integration. Critical components still requiring implementation include API integrations, template rendering, UI components, and comprehensive testing infrastructure.

All code follows the architecture specifications defined in the JSON files and implements proper error handling, logging, and fallback mechanisms as specified in the DEADLIGHT protocol.
