# CIVIC TRACE OPS — System Architecture Blueprint

## 1. Overview

The architecture for CIVIC TRACE OPS aims to be modular, allowing future expansions into different states or deeper data analytics. Below is a high-level proposal of the key components.

[Scraping/FOIA Pipeline] [External Data Sources]

## 2. Frontend

- **Tech Choice**: React (with Next.js) or Streamlit for rapid dashboard deployment.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Render the user interface (location selectors, decision chain visualization).
  - Handle user input for FOIA generation.
  - Display risk scores and relevant documents.

## 3. Backend API

- **Tech Choice**: Python Flask or Node.js/Express.
- **Endpoints**:
  1. **Location Data**: Return counties, agencies, and known public officials.
  2. **Risk Score Calculation**: Combine data from child welfare records and external audits.
  3. **FOIA Request Generator**: Ties in with template logic, merges user input with standard text.
- **Authentication**: Could be minimal or token-based, depending on whether user accounts are needed.

## 4. Data Layer

- **Database**: PostgreSQL or Firebase.
  - **PostgreSQL** advantage: robust relational queries (e.g., linking persons to agencies).
  - **Firebase** advantage: real-time updates and simpler hosting environment.
- **Data Structures**:
  - **User Queries**: Storing user interactions or saved FOIA requests.
  - **Public Official / Agency Data**: Key identifiers, roles, known addresses, or budgets.
  - **FOIA Logs**: Each request submitted or generated is logged (metadata and content).

## 5. Scraping/FOIA Pipeline Logic

- **Scraping**:
  - Periodic crawlers gather publicly available data:
    - State contractor databases
    - Court dockets and opinions
    - Government spending sites
- **FOIA Submission**:
  - If the platform provides direct submission, handle emailing or auto-filling official FOIA web portals.
  - Otherwise, generate PDFs or docx for manual submission.

## 6. External Data Sources

- **FEC**: Federal Election Commission data might reveal campaign contributions or conflicts.
- **IRS 990**: Nonprofit financial disclosures for child welfare or foster agencies.
- **State Contractor DBs**: Info on awarded contracts, key vendors in child welfare.
- **Court Records**: Docket info that might reveal patterns or decisions.

## 7. Optional Integrations

- **Guardian Stack Seer**: Automated monitoring for relevant local news, audits, or watchdog reports.
- **Local Watchdog Alerts**: Subscription-based feature that notifies the user if certain triggers are identified (e.g., new budget anomalies, repeated complaints).
