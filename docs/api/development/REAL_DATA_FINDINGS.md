# üö® REAL DATA FINDINGS - NO BULLSHIT

## ALL ENDPOINTS FAILED (404)

1. Child Welfare Search

```
‚ùå /catalog.json - 404 Not Found
```

2. HHS/ACF Data

```
‚ùå /childrens-bureau/afcars/states - 404 Not Found
‚ùå /acf/child-welfare - 404 Not Found
```

3. State CPS Data

```
‚ùå CA - 404 Not Found
‚ùå TX - 404 Not Found
‚ùå NY - 404 Not Found
```

## WHAT THIS MEANS

1. The Data.gov endpoints we're trying DO NOT EXIST
2. We have NO working child welfare data sources
3. All our previous mock data was COMPLETELY FAKE
4. We need to find the REAL endpoints

## IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED

1. Research the actual Data.gov API structure

   - Current endpoints are wrong
   - Need to find correct documentation
   - May need different base URL

2. Find Real Government Data Sources

   - Direct HHS website APIs
   - State-specific CPS portals
   - AFCARS direct access
   - ACF data warehouse

3. Remove All Fake Data
   - Delete mock NCMEC client
   - Remove fake statistics
   - Stop pretending we have data we don't

## NEXT STEPS

1. Check these REAL sources:

   - https://www.acf.hhs.gov/cb/research-data-technology/statistics-research
   - https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/systemwide/statistics/
   - Individual state CPS department APIs

2. Document What Actually Exists

   - Real API endpoints
   - Data refresh rates
   - Access requirements
   - Rate limits

3. Build Real Integrations
   - No more mock data
   - Real statistics only
   - Actual government sources

## BOTTOM LINE

**WE HAVE NOTHING RIGHT NOW**

- ‚ùå No working APIs
- ‚ùå No real data
- ‚ùå No valid endpoints
- ‚ùå All previous data was fake

We need to start over with REAL data sources or shut this down.
