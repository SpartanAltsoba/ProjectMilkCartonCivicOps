# ACTUAL API STATUS - NO BULLSHIT

## What We Actually Have:

1. **Data.gov API** (https://api.data.gov/v1)

   - Need to test what REAL child welfare data is available
   - Need to verify what endpoints actually work

2. **FEC API** (https://api.open.fec.gov/v1)
   - Campaign finance data
   - Not relevant for child welfare

## What We Don't Have:

1. **NCMEC Integration**

   - Current implementation is ALL MOCK DATA
   - NO real connection to NCMEC
   - NO real statistics
   - COMPLETELY FAKE risk scores

2. **Real Child Welfare Data**
   - Need to find actual government data sources
   - Need real CPS statistics
   - Need actual case numbers

## Next Steps:

1. Test Data.gov API to see what REAL child welfare data we can access
2. Remove all fake/mock data implementations
3. Document what data we actually need but don't have
4. Research legitimate data sources for child welfare statistics

## Bottom Line:

We need to stop bullshitting and find REAL data sources that can actually help parents.
