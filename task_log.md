**Exit Criteria Required:**
- ❌ All templates render with zero placeholder gaps
- ❌ PDF + DOCX formats supported

**Components Missing:**
- AdvisoryWorker implementation
- Template rendering engine
- Top-20 action templates

## Sprint S-6: UI Wiring ❌ NOT STARTED
**Exit Criteria Required:**
- ❌ Run Cypress end-to-end 'parent happy path'

**Components Missing:**
- Decision-Chain renderer
- Live COA pop-outs

## Sprint S-7: Self-Test Harness ❌ NOT STARTED
**Exit Criteria Required:**
- ❌ 0 critical failures for 5 days

**Components Missing:**

## CRITICAL TODOs TO COMPLETE SYSTEM

### 1. API INTEGRATIONS (BLOCKING)
- [ ] CSE API implementation in ReconWorker
- [ ] FEC API implementation in ReconWorker  
- [ ] Neo4j Cypher queries for cycle detection
- [ ] OpenAI service integration for ML scoring

### 2. MISSING CORE COMPONENTS (BLOCKING)
- [ ] AdvisoryWorker with template engine
- [ ] Decision-Chain UI renderer
- [ ] Self-test harness with canary tests
- [ ] Pipeline coordinator orchestration
- [ ] FSM state machine implementation

### 3. DATA VALIDATION & TESTING (BLOCKING)
- [ ] Alabama sample dataset for coverage testing
- [ ] Gold dataset for precision/recall validation
- [ ] Cypher acceptance test suite
- [ ] End-to-end Cypress tests

### 4. PERFORMANCE & MONITORING (BLOCKING)
- [ ] P95 latency measurement infrastructure
- [ ] Coverage ratio tracking
- [ ] Flag precision/recall metrics
- [ ] Self-heal framework integration

### 5. TEMPLATE SYSTEM (BLOCKING)
- [ ] Top-20 action templates for all jurisdictions
- [ ] PDF/DOCX rendering engine (WeasyPrint integration)
- [ ] Template gap detection and fallback

### 6. PRODUCTION READINESS (BLOCKING)
- [ ] Circuit breakers for external services
- [ ] Comprehensive retry strategies
- [ ] Error logging and monitoring
- [ ] Deployment observability stack

**SYSTEM STATUS: 25% COMPLETE - REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL WORK**
